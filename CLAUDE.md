## Context Survival (CRITICAL — read this first after every compaction)

**After compaction or at session start:**

1. Read all `PLAN_*.md` files in the project root — these are the active goals
2. Run `TaskList` to see tracked tasks with status
3. Do NOT start new work without checking these first

**During work:**

- When the user gives a new requirement, add it to the relevant `PLAN_*.md` or create a new one
- Track all user goals as Tasks with status (pending -> in_progress -> completed)
- Update `PLAN_*.md` with progress before context gets large

**PLAN file pattern:**

- Active plans live at project root: `PLAN_<DESCRIPTION>.md`
- Each plan has user assertions verbatim at the top (non-negotiable requirements)
- Plans track problems, fixes applied, and verification criteria
- If no plan file exists for the current work, create one before starting
- Never nest plans in subdirectories — always project root

## Quick Reference

This repository manages the **root AWS account** (887764105431) for diyaccounting.co.uk:

- **Route53 hosted zone** for `diyaccounting.co.uk` (all DNS records)
- **RootDnsStack**: Alias records pointing to gateway/spreadsheets CloudFront distributions
- **ApexStack** (ci + prod): Maintenance page at `ci-holding.diyaccounting.co.uk` /
  `holding.diyaccounting.co.uk`, CloudFront distribution tagged `OriginFor=<holding domain>`
- **Cross-account delegation role**: `root-route53-record-delegate`, trusted by the submit, gateway
  and spreadsheets accounts via `sts:AssumeRole` from their own deployment roles, so no GitHub OIDC
  trust reaches this account. It grants records in the hosted zone only — enough for both alias
  upserts and ACM certificate-validation CNAMEs.

**What this repo does NOT have**: Lambda, DynamoDB, Cognito, API Gateway, Docker, ngrok, HMRC, Stripe, or any application code.

## Skills

Skills live at `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, each with a root symlink (`SKILL_<NAME>.md`) for
convenience — gitignored, recreate with `ln -s` if missing.

- `.claude/skills/plain-prose/SKILL.md` — writing rules for plain, human prose; follow this for all human-facing text (docs, comments, chat)
- `.claude/skills/do-next/SKILL.md` — dispatch `NEXT.md`'s open items as worktree-isolated sub-agents

## Git Workflow

See `../CLAUDE.md` for full rules. Branch naming: `claude/<short-description>`.

## CDK Architecture

**Single CDK application** (`cdk-root/`):

- Entry point: `RootEnvironment.java` -> `submit-root.jar`
- Stacks: `root-RootDnsStack` (Route53 alias records + delegation role), `ci-root-ApexStack` and
  `prod-root-ApexStack` (apex holding page CloudFront distributions)

**Java packages** (`co.uk.diyaccounting.root`):

- `root` — `RootEnvironment.java` (entry point), `SubmitSharedNames.java` (shared config)
- `root.stacks` — `RootDnsStack.java`, `ApexStack.java`, `SubmitStackProps.java`
- `root.utils` — `Kind.java` (logging), `KindCdk.java` (CDK utilities), `Route53AliasUpsert.java` (DNS alias), `ResourceNameUtils.java` (name conversion)

## Formatting

- Spotless with Palantir Java Format (100-column width)
- Runs during Maven `install` phase
- Fix: `./mvnw spotless:apply` (only when asked)

## IAM Best Practices

- Follow least privilege principle
- Avoid `Resource: "*"` wildcards
- Use specific ARNs where possible

## Deployment

Deployments are triggered via GitHub Actions workflows:

| Workflow             | Purpose                                                            | Trigger              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| `test.yml`           | Lint, format check, Maven verify, CDK synth                        | Push, daily schedule |
| `deploy.yml`         | Deploy RootDnsStack + apex ApexStacks                              | Manual dispatch      |
| `deploy-holding.yml` | Fail the gateway domains over to the holding page, or restore them | Manual dispatch      |

`deploy-holding.yml` moves the live gateway aliases between two accounts. It strips them from
`{env}-gateway-GatewayStack`'s distribution in the gateway account, then adds them to the holding
distribution in the management account, which it finds by the `OriginFor` tag `ApexStack` sets
(`ci-holding.diyaccounting.co.uk` or `holding.diyaccounting.co.uk`) via `resourcegroupstaggingapi`.
Finally it repoints the A/AAAA records in the hosted zone. `target: restore` runs the same moves in
reverse. The domains it moves are `ci-gateway.diyaccounting.co.uk` for ci, and
`diyaccounting.co.uk`, `www.diyaccounting.co.uk` and `prod-gateway.diyaccounting.co.uk` for prod —
the same list `ApexStack` issues its certificate over, because CloudFront rejects an alias the
certificate does not cover.

`deploy.yml` refuses to run while a failover is live. It checks each holding distribution's aliases
first and fails if one is serving a live domain, because `RootDnsStack` would repoint the records at
the live distributions and `ApexStack` would strip the live aliases back off the holding
distribution. Run `deploy-holding.yml` with `target: restore` first.

Both workflows use OIDC authentication with these GitHub repository variables:

| Variable                        | Value                                                             | Purpose                            |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `GATEWAY_ACTIONS_ROLE_ARN`      | `arn:aws:iam::283165661847:role/gateway-github-actions-role`      | OIDC auth for gateway account      |
| `GATEWAY_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN`       | `arn:aws:iam::283165661847:role/gateway-deployment-role`          | CloudFront lookups in gateway      |
| `SPREADSHEETS_ACTIONS_ROLE_ARN` | `arn:aws:iam::064390746177:role/spreadsheets-github-actions-role` | OIDC auth for spreadsheets account |
| `SPREADSHEETS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN`  | `arn:aws:iam::064390746177:role/spreadsheets-deployment-role`     | CloudFront lookups in spreadsheets |
| `ROOT_ACTIONS_ROLE_ARN`         | `arn:aws:iam::887764105431:role/root-github-actions-role`         | OIDC auth for root account         |
| `ROOT_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN`          | `arn:aws:iam::887764105431:role/root-deployment-role`             | CDK deploy in root account         |
| `ROOT_ACCOUNT_ID`               | `887764105431`                                                    | Root account identifier            |
| `ROOT_HOSTED_ZONE_ID`           | `Z0315522208PWZSSBI9AL`                                           | Route53 hosted zone ID             |

Each OIDC actions role trusts both `repo:diy-accounting-uk/root.diyaccounting.co.uk:*` and `repo:diy-accounting-uk/submit.diyaccounting.co.uk:*`.

**GitHub Environment**: The `deploy-root-dns` job uses `environment: prod`. This environment must exist in Settings > Environments.

## AWS CLI Access

Use SSO profiles:

```bash
aws sso login --sso-session diyaccounting
aws --profile management route53 list-hosted-zones
aws --profile management cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name root-RootDnsStack --region us-east-1
```

**Read-only AWS operations are always permitted.** Ask before any write operations.

## AWS Write Operations

See `../CLAUDE.md` — always ask before any mutating AWS operation.

## Confirm Means Stop and Wait

See `../CLAUDE.md` — present the command, STOP, wait for explicit approval before executing.

## Code Quality Rules

See `../CLAUDE.md` for shared rules. Root-specific: only run `./mvnw spotless:apply` when specifically asked.

## Security Checklist

See `../CLAUDE.md` for shared rules. Root-specific: Route53 delegation role is scoped to specific hosted zone only.

## Corpus search (corpus-loom MCP)

The `corpus-loom` MCP tools (`search`, `get_document`, `related_entities`) query one hybrid BM25+semantic index (~48.7k documents) spanning the whole business, not just this repo:

- **Repos**: all five diy-accounting-uk checkouts — tracked files at main plus full commit logs. This repo's source name is `root`.
- **`drive`**: the DIY Accounting Limited Google Drive mirror — finance, minutes, personnel, product, support, technology, marketing, facilities. PDF/doc/docx content-indexed; spreadsheets metadata-only (findable by name).
- **`mail-antony` / `mail-support`**: complete Gmail backups of antony@ and support@diyaccounting.co.uk (2012→present).
- **Entities**: email addresses, seeded orgs (NatWest, HMRC, Companies House, Stripe, PayPal), Drive categories — `related_entities` links a person/org across mail, documents, and commits.

Source names for filters: `drive`, `mail-antony`, `mail-support`, `submit`, `spreadsheets`, `www`, `root`, `archive`. Drive `finance/` and `personnel/` are lexical-only (deliberately never embedded) — exact-token queries work there, paraphrase queries don't. Use this before grepping siblings or asking the operator for history.
